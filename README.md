# Crop Recommendation System

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application designed to recommend the most suitable crop types for given environmental conditions.
Utilizing data on soil type, climate, and precipitation, our system leverages a RandomForestClassifier to provide data-driven crop recommendations. 
This tool aims to assist farmers, agricultural researchers, and hobbyists in making informed decisions to maximize yield and sustainability.

## Features

- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Utilizes historical farming data to predict optimal crop types.
- **Environmental Consideration**: Takes into account various environmental factors such as soil type, climate, and precipitation.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Employs RandomForestClassifier for accurate prediction models.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated with other systems through a straightforward API.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd crop-recommendation-system
```

2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To predict the recommended crop type based on environmental conditions, run:

```bash
python recommend_crop.py --soil_type loamy --climate temperate --precipitation 500
```

Replace the values for `--soil_type`, `--climate`, and `--precipitation` with your specific conditions.
